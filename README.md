This is an introductory tutorial to classification and regression trees.

Classification and regression trees are machine learning methods for constructing prediction models from data. Their basic idea is to repeatedly split data into groups so that observations that end up the same group have similar responses. They are extremely flexible in terms of the data they can handle and offer an alternative to, for example, generalised linear models when the primary goal is to predict or classify an outcome. This tutorial gives a practical introduction to fitting classification and regression trees in R, including some extensions like bagging, boosting and random forests that can be used to improve predictive accuracy.
